The above command will start the server and you will be able to see the locally hosted website link . But wait , we still got to host the JSON data so that we can fetch from it.

Now open another terminal in your code editor and change the directories just as you did above. 

**If not in dashboardAccuknox directory** 
```bash
  cd dashboardAccuknox
```
```bash
  cd app 
```
Now in this terminal , we are going to host a json file locally using json server package . 

**Run the below command to start the JSON server**
```bash
  npx json-server --watch data/data.json --port 3600
```
